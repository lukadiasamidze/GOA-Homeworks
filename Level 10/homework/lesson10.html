    <h1>Hello, today we will talk about Georgia. Georgia is a transcontinental country in Eastern Europe and West Asia. It is part of the Caucasus region. Georgia is known for it's wine and culture. The first political union was created by Daokhi and Colcha at the end of the 2nd century BCE, in the Chorokhi river basin. The kingdom of Iberia developed in the 4th century BCE on the territory of modern-day eastern Georgia. The kingdom of Colchis (also known as Egrisi) was just next door in modern-day western Georgia.</h1>
